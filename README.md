# Vet Clinic Database
This database includes animals data from Vet Clinic.


## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database. **Important note: this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!**

<!-- FAQ (optional) -->

## ❓ FAQ <a name="faq"></a>


- **[How do I reset the database to its initial state?]**

  - [You can reset the database by re-running the `schema.sql` file to recreate the tables and the `data.sql` file to populate the tables with sample data. Be cautious as this will erase any existing data.]

- **[Can I use this database for a real vet clinic?]**

  - [The provided database and sample data are for educational and testing purposes. To use it for a real vet clinic, you would need to design the database with additional features, data validation, and security measures.
